# 📝 Paste App  

**Paste App** is a lightweight notes and snippets manager built with **React**.  
It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes while storing them securely in **localStorage** for persistence.  
Each note can be **copied to the clipboard** or converted into a **shareable link**, making it a handy tool for personal note-taking or sharing snippets.
